# MS-SCAA
Multispecies statistical-catch-at-age model     
          
The 3Species directory contains the files from the 3-species MS-SCAA model from Curti et al 2012 (https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0229)        

The 9Species directory builds upon the 3-Species model.  Changes include modification to the size-preference formulation to allow for asymmetric size preference curves, and modification to the input consumption:biomass array (CB) so that the rates can vary not only by species and age, but also by year.
